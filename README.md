This is a template for creating an [HTML GitBook style](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/html.html#gitbook-style) **[bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown)** book, [hosted on GitHub Pages](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/github.html). It is based on the one created with *File, New Project..., New Directory, Book Project using bookdown* in RStudio. It assumes you know how to use git/GitHub and R Markdown, and have some familiarity with the **bookdown** package. If you don't, the package author Yihue Xie's RStudio webinar *[Introduction to Bookdown (R Package)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVqVscgwSpw)* provides an excellent introduction. In addition, check out [*bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown*](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown), also by Yihui Xie, both for the content and the format--it is itself a **bookdown** book.

### Render the book

- [ ] 1. Install **bookdown** with `install.packages("bookdown")`. If you already have it, update to the [latest version](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bookdown).

- [ ] 2. Render locally with `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")`.

- [ ] 3. Use `browseURL("docs/index.html")` to view your book locally (or just open `index.html` in a browser).

- [ ] 4. If it looks good, commit and push all changed files to GitHub. 

(You will need to repeat steps 2 and 4 every time you wish to update the book online.)

### Edit README

Once you've completed these steps, delete the content of this **README** and add a short description of your project with a link to the book URL. It would be appreciated if you add the following to the end:

*This repo was initially generated from a bookdown template available here: https://github.com/jtr13/bookdown-template.*

(And starring the repo would be nice too so I can see if this is getting used or not!)
